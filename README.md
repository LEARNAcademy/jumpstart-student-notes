### üíé Treasure Hunt Challenge

During Jumpstart, each group is tasked with creating a treasure hunt web game. When developers are planning a project it is a common practice to break down the task into a series of acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria are the statements that need to be true in order for our task to be complete.

- I can see a webpage with a treasure hunt game.
- I can see a header with the name of my game.
- I can see a list of rules describing how to play the treasure hunt game.
- I can see a three by three gird board game with a question mark on each square.
- When I click on a square, the question mark will turn into an icon.
- If I click the winning square a treasure icon will appear.
- If I click the losing square a bomb icon will appear.
- If I click any other square a neutral icon will appear.
- If I click on the square with the treasure, I will see a notification that I won the game.
- If I click on the square with the bomb, I will see a notification that I lost the game.
- I can continue clicking squares until I hit the treasure or the bomb.
- Once I win or lose I can no longer play the game.
- I can click a button to play a new game.

#### Stretch Challenges

Stretch challenges are additional acceptance criteria that can be implemented after the base challenge has been completed.

- I can see a counter that tells me the number of turns I have left.
- If I run out of turns I will see a notification that I lost.

### üë• Pair Programming

Pair programming is the process of two people working together to create one project. It is a common practice in development teams and is used to allow for knowledge sharing, increase communication and accountability, and decrease syntax errors and distractions.

There are two roles in pair programming. The `driver` will share their screen and have hands on the keyboard. The `navigator` is managing resources and thinking out loud to support the driver.

As long as you are working together on the same project and communicating you are doing it right.

### ü§ù Sharing Code in Slack

Slack is an instant messaging platform we use for communication and resource sharing. To send code in Slack use a code block. There is a "code block" selection available within the chat box options in Slack. The Slack chat font will often add invisible characters or modify punctuation causing errors in your code. Using a code block will prevent this from occurring.

### üó£ Communication

Being a successful developer is being an excellent communicator.

If you are going to be out of class for any reason, please inform the instructors. We can all be reached in Slack.
